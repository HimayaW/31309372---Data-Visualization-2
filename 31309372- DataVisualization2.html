          <p>Asylum seekers are immigrants, who are displaced to live in another place against their will, mostly because of war or other factors
          harming them or their family (UN Refugee Agency, 2021). This visualization focuses on which countries are these asylum seekers originated from, to which countries 
        they move to and decisions taken by countries of asylum during the years 2006 to 2020. 
        <br><br>The decisions taken by countries of asylum includes <b>Recognized decisions</b>, <b>Complementary protection</b> and <b>Rejected decisions</b>.

        <p>The world map here shows the number of applications made by asylum seekers acccording to their country
          of origin. Countries like <b>Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine</b> and <b>Venezuela</b> are some countries that had the highest 
          asylum seekers (more than 150000) throughout the years of 2006 and 2020. 
          <br><br>Countries like the <b>United States, United Kingdom, Canada</b> and <b>Australia</b> have the lowest asylum seeker applications, which shows that most asylum 
          seekers are originated from developing countries which had wars, which is not the case in developed countries.
          The highest number of asylum applicants were in 2015, which was the year of Europe Refugee Crisis, according to BBC(2016).

        <p>The above stacked bar graph demonstrates the total number of applicants that were accepted into the country of
           asylum. The top 10 countries that have accepted applicants vary throughout the years of 2006 and 2020. The 
           highest accepting countries of asylum include both developed and developing countries. Acceptance of applicants 
           are dividing into 2 categories, applicants that are <b>recognized</b> as asylums and applicants that are provided <b>complementary
           protection</b>. Most applicants are recognized asylum applicants. <b>Germany</b> has accepted the highest number of applicants 
           continuously in the recent years. <b>Russia</b> has accepted the highest number of applicants with complementary protection.

        <p>The top 10 countries with the highest rejections (in absolute terms) in total are from <b>Germany, France, United States of 
          America, United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Australia, South Africa, Greece</b> and <b>Belgium</b>. These have the highest rejections because of
          they have the largest number of applicants as well (most of them being developed countries). Some reasons as to why
          these countries refuse asylum seekers is because of fears in economic competiton, persistent rift within a country's society and 
          the possibility of terror attacks from occuring.
          <br><br>
          Overall, <b>Germany</b> has had the highest rejected applicants, with 279426 applicants rejected in 2017 alone. Years with lower rejections
          could also be due to lower number of applicants. In year 2020, the pandemic has prevented people from migrating or moving from one country to
          another, which reduces the number of asylum applicants.

            <p> <b>Recognition rate</b> is the percentage at which the country of asylum takes in asylum seekers that are recognized by the government  over the total number 
              of applicants (both accepted and rejected applicants) (UN Refugee Agency, 2009). Recognition rate is an internationally recognized and agreed methodology used to calculate the percentage
              of applicants accepted with refugee convention. 
              <br><br>
                This boxplot shows the distribution of recognition rates throughout the years 2006 and 2020. As demonstrated the distribution of recognition rates changes from 
                year to year (length of the boxplot). The median recognition rate, shown in white, fluctuates continuously throughout the years but it has an overall upward trend with the highest
                median recognition rate in 2020 and a percentage of <b>68.67%</b>. The lowest median recognition percentage was <b>36.13%</b> in the year 2012.

          <p>The percentage of rejected applicants is calculated by dividing the total number of rejected applicants over total number of decisions made. Closed spplication
            percentage is calculated by divding the total number of closed applications over the total number of decisions made. Closed application decisions refer to the applications 
            made by asylum seekers who withdraw their application, applicants who haven't attended the interview or applicants who have died before the interview. In UNCHR statistics
            these are referred to as "Otherwise Closed" decisions.
            <br><br>
            This scatter plot shows that there is a <b>negative relationship</b> between the percentage of applicants rejected and the percentage of closed applications. This means that when the 
            percentage of rejected applicats (Rejection Rate) increased the percentage of closed applications fall and vice versa. This explains that if the country of asylum rejects more 
            and more applicants as a percentage of their total decisions, the percentage of asylum applicants who withdraw their application or become absent in their interviews decrease. 
            This maybe because withdrawing applications and not attending interviews increases the chances of rejected applications whenever they apply the next time.
